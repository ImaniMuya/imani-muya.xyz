                        I enjoy using storytelling as a tool that to remove barriers between people of different backgrounds.
                        My hope is that through my storytelling I can give voices to the sides that are told less often.
                        I have found a passion for documentary storytelling where I get to go out in the world and find amazing people.
                        I have also found a love for developing my own characters and stories,
                        making them feel real and relatable, and watching them interact with a world that I create for them.

                        An intersection of creativity and logic that I have had the privilege of diving into is game development.
                        It seems a little strange because I didn't grow up playing video games,
                        but in college, I've spent many hours making them.
                        I have competed in the Computer Science and Engineering department’s
                        <a href="https://gamejam.cse.taylor.edu" target="_blank">gamejam</a> for the past 3 years.
                        I have made games from platformers to puzzles, and even a tower defense.
                        Working alongside incredibly talented people has made it possible for me to 
                        learn and create things that I would not have been able to do on my own.
